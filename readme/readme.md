RetailRocket Funnel Analysis (SQL + Tableau)

This project analyzes e-commerce user behavior using RetailRocket event data.

The main goal was to:
Build session logic (sessionization with a 30-minute inactivity threshold)
Calculate funnel conversion rates (View â†’ Cart â†’ Purchase)
Visualize results in Tableau

ðŸ”§ Tools & Skills
SQL: window functions, CTEs, sessionization, funnel metrics
Tableau: funnel breakdown, time-series trends, interactive visualization
Analytics: conversion analysis, user journey insights, KPI tracking

ðŸ“Š Key Findings
Only 2.5% of sessions progressed from View â†’ Cart
31.8% of carts converted into purchases
Overall, just 0.8% of viewing sessions resulted in a transaction

ðŸ”Ž Business Insights
- Low Viewâ†’Cart conversion (2.5%) points to possible product attractiveness or UX issues â†’ requires attention from marketing & product teams (product recommendations, CTA optimization, A/B testing).
- Strong Cartâ†’Purchase conversion (31.8%) shows that once users add items, they are relatively committed. The bottleneck lies in motivating users to add to cart.
- Overall Viewâ†’Purchase conversion (0.8%) indicates a significant opportunity for retargeting, personalization, and promotional campaigns.
